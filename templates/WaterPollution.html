    <h2>Effects of Water Pollution</h2>
    <p>Water has been widely known for being the solvent that is capable of dissolving various substances. Because of this, water can be easily polluted. When harmful substances are released into bodies of water, such as streams or rivers, they easily dissolve and mix with the water resulting in contamination.</p>
    <p>There have been many known effects of water pollution that have proven to be detrimental to one’s health. The most notable danger associated with water pollution is that it can make one ill and in the worst-case scenario it could cause the death of a human being. It’s able to do this because polluted water can contain waterborne pathogens which can contribute to the rapid spread of diseases, especially in communities in which poverty exists. Not only are humans subject to the harmful dangers of water pollution, but aquatic wildlife too. Aquatic creatures are incapable of thriving when they’re exposed to contaminants and are forced to live in unlivable conditions.
